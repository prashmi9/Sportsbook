### Notes

1. I have added Unit tests for Service and event-list components just to give an idea of the knowledge.
2. I have assumed the Team names and added as tab titles
3. Know issue - After events subscriptions to receive the events data , it takes some time to render on the component view. This can be fixed by using Store module.
